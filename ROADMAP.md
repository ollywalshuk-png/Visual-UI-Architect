# Visual UI Architect — Roadmap & Phase Tracker

Single source of truth for phase status. Update the **Status** column as work
lands. `done` = built, `swift build` clean, `swift run VUACheck` green, and
visible/integrated. `partial` = some sub-items shipped, gaps listed. `planned`
= not started (placeholder so it isn't forgotten).

Verification gate for every phase: `swift build` → `swift run VUACheck` →
rebuild app bundle → update README → commit when green.

† **History note (2026-06-09):** the original `.git` directory was lost when
the project was restored from a Google Drive zip export (Drive strips
dot-directories). All commit hashes above for Phases 1–9 refer to that lost
history and exist only as a record. The repository was re-initialised from the
recovered source — verified `swift build` clean and VUACheck 154/0 at recovery
— starting at commit `f86cd8b` ("Recovered baseline"). Lesson: back up the
repo with `git bundle` or push to a remote, not via folder-zip exports.

## Standing rules
- Local-first, no paid/cloud deps, no telemetry.
- Keep SwiftSyntax for round-trip (no regex parsing).
- Don't delete modules without an equivalent replacement.
- Never commit a failing build; never hide validation/build/export safety.
- Toolchain: Swift CLT only (no Xcode) → verify with `swift run VUACheck`,
  not `swift test`; generated code avoids the `#Preview` macro on export.
