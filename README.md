# Visual UI Architect

A developer-focused **visual UI engineering environment** for Apple platforms.
Manipulate real application layouts on a Photoshop/Figma-style canvas while the
system keeps design and production-quality code in sync.

> Visual-first code engineering — not a mock-up tool, not low-code.

## Status

- **Phase 1 — Foundation:** runnable macOS app, modular engines, visual editing,
  SwiftUI codegen, validation, git, AI abstraction.
- **Phase 2 — Repository round-trip (done):** open existing SwiftUI files/repos,
  parse views into layers with **SwiftSyntax** (no regex), edit visually, and
  **apply changes back to source preserving comments/formatting**. External edits
  (e.g. from Xcode) refresh the canvas automatically. Safe-apply pipeline:
  validate → write → `swift build` → git diff.
- **Phase 3 — Assets + plugin components (done):** asset library (import
  PNG/JPEG/SVG/PDF, search, tags, lock, replace, **drag onto canvas**); plugin
  controls (**knob/fader/meter/slider/switch**) as first-class layers carrying
  **AU parameter metadata** (id, range, default, unit, steps) edited in the
  inspector and emitted into generated SwiftUI; **asset name write-back** to
  source via the safe-apply pipeline.
- **Phase 4 — Controls library + constraint editor (done):** a real reusable
  SwiftUI control library (**`VUAControls`**: `KnobView`, `FaderView`,
  `MeterView`, `ControlView`) that generated code `import`s and parameterises
  with each control's range/default/label; a **visual constraint editor**
  (pin edges, center, fix size) on top of `ConstraintEngine`, with a *Resolve*
  action that re-lays a layer for the current size. A `ControlsExample` target
  compiles generated-style code against the library so the API can't drift.
- **Phase 5 — Export Integrity Pipeline (done):** generated SwiftUI is now
  **portable and target-buildable**. The new **`ExportIntegrityEngine`** writes
  a self-contained SwiftPM package containing the generated view, every
  referenced image (SwiftSyntax-scanned, sanitised, copied), the
  **`VUAControls` sources** as a local module, an asset manifest, an AU
  **parameter manifest**, and a human-readable export report. Diagnostics
  cover missing/unresolved assets, duplicate filenames, unsupported formats,
  unsafe filenames, placeholder parameters, unbound controls, and
  unsatisfiable imports. The verification harness exports a Trinity8-style UI
  to a temp dir and **runs `swift build` on the exported package**, so the
  test fails if generated code ever stops compiling outside Visual UI Architect.
- **Phase 6 — Persistence (done):** projects save as a **`.vuaproj` document
  bundle** (`document.json` + `Assets/`) — a single self-contained item that
  travels between machines with the layout *and* every imported image. New
  `PersistenceEngine`. Standard File menu (`⌘N` / `⌘O` / `⌘S` / `⌘⇧S` / Open
  Recent), dirty-state tracking, "Edited" marker in the title bar, and
  **auto-reopen of the last document on launch**. Imported assets are copied
  into the bundle on save so the project survives the original import path
  going away.
- **Phase 7 — General-purpose UI tools (done):** Visual UI Architect is no
  longer plugin-only. New layer kinds — **groups**, **shapes**
  (rectangle/rounded/ellipse/capsule/star/divider/card/glass/callout),
  **lines/arrows**, **polygons/stars**, **gradients**, and **masks** — each
  with fill/stroke/corner-radius/opacity/**shadow**/**blur**/**rotation**, plus
  **layer roles**, notes, and tags. **Clipboard** (cut/copy/paste with fresh
  ids), **multi-selection** (shift/⌘-click, group transform, align/distribute),
  **group/ungroup**, full **z-order** (front/back/forward/backward), and a
  **23-preset library** (app screens, panels, cards, dashboards, forms, modals,
  and plugin blocks like oscillator/filter/ADSR/mixer). Code generation emits
  real SwiftUI shapes, `Path`s, `LinearGradient`/`RadialGradient`/`AngularGradient`,
  `.clipShape`/`.mask`, `.shadow`/`.blur`/`.rotationEffect` — anchors preserved.
  The repository parser maps `Rectangle`/`RoundedRectangle`/`Circle`/`Capsule`/
  `Divider` to shape layers (SwiftSyntax, no regex). Validation gained
  structural checks (zero-size, invisible, transparent, invalid polygon,
  missing asset, empty group, inverted mask). The harness exports a
  shapes+gradient+group+star UI and **`swift build`s it** to prove portability.

- **Phase 8 — Canvas workflow (done):** professional canvas navigation —
  **zoom to fit / 100% / to-selection**, pinch-to-zoom, and zoom ± with a
  shared clamp; a **grid overlay** with adjustable spacing and **snap-to-grid**;
  draggable **ruler guides** (double-click to remove) that layers snap to;
  **rulers** with auto-spaced "nice" tick steps that never crowd at any zoom;
  and live **alignment guides** while dragging (edge/center). The snap maths
  (`CanvasGrid`, `CanvasViewport`, `CanvasRuler`, `AlignmentGuides`) live in
  `CanvasEngine` and are unit-checked.

- **Phase 9 — Document safety (done):** **autosave** (timer → recovery file) and
  **crash recovery** (a restore prompt on next launch if the previous session
  didn't exit cleanly); **save-before-close** prompt (`⌘W` Close command →
  Save / Don't Save / Cancel); **version snapshots** stored inside
  `.vuaproj/Snapshots/` (captured on every save, pruned to the newest 25, with a
  restore browser); and **corrupted-document diagnostics** (`VUABundle.diagnose`)
  so a damaged or incomplete bundle reports a clear reason instead of crashing.
  Gap-closure follow-up: **save-before-open / save-before-new** guards routed
  through the same dirty-check as Close; **recovery conflict classification**
  (recovery newer / older than the saved project, surfaced in the restore
  prompt); and an **open-document registry** that detects the same `.vuaproj`
  being edited from two windows/instances.

- **Phase 10 — Repo / workspace safety (done):** new **`WorkspaceEngine`**.
  `WorkspaceResolver` scans a chosen root and builds a **`WorkspaceContext`**
  (repo root, branch, latest commit, dirty state, Package/xcodeproj/xcworkspace
  inventory, source files, asset roots, scan timestamp, confidence score) with
  diagnostics for the dangerous cases: **nested/multiple repos**, multiple
  `Package.swift`, **generated-export-folder selected as source repo**,
  `.build`/dependency folders selected accidentally, dirty tree, detached HEAD,
  merge/rebase in progress, git lock files, and **stale scans** (file changed
  or deleted after parse). The context **refreshes before Apply-to-Source** and
  blocks/warns instead of writing into the wrong place. A **Workspace
  Diagnostics** panel (toolbar) shows the active repo/branch/dirty badges and
  every detected warning.

- **Phase 11 — Build intelligence (done):** new **`BuildIntelligenceEngine`**.
  Models the build lifecycle (Workspace Resolve → Package Resolve → Swift Build
  → Verify → Export Build → App Bundle → Artifact) and build kinds
  (dev/debug/release/CI/staging/production/export-validation); probes the
  **toolchain** (Swift version, CLT-only vs full Xcode); inspects packages
  (missing `Package.swift`, missing/**stale `Package.resolved`**, cold `.build`
  cache); scans generated source for **imports that won't resolve**, a
  VUAControls dependency that isn't bundled, and `#Preview` on CLT-only
  machines; formats the **exact repeatable build command**; and translates raw
  build failures into **plain-English explanations** (no-such-module, manifest
  parse, fetch failures, linker errors, name collisions…). A **Build
  Diagnostics** panel (toolbar ▸ hammer) shows context, pipeline, command, and
  diagnostics.

- **Phase 12 — Source / asset / layer hardening (done):** a **`HardeningValidator`**
  (duplicate layer IDs, duplicate source anchors, off-canvas layers, hidden-parent
  traps, fully-transparent gradients, background-above-controls and
  control-behind-opaque-panel z-order mistakes, asset name collisions — exact,
  case-only, and sanitised — plus missing/external asset files) and a
  **`SourceSafety` preflight** that runs before every Apply-to-Source: merge-conflict
  markers, read-only/missing files, **external-edit detection via SHA-256 source
  hashes**, CRLF/tab fingerprints (preserved on write), and **anchor sanity**
  (each targeted anchor must exist exactly once). The safe-apply pipeline gained
  a blocking **preflight stage** between validate and write.

- **Phase 13 — Handoff generator (done):** new **`HandoffGeneratorEngine`** —
  renders a deterministic **HANDOFF.md** (mission, verified repo/build/check
  state, module map, capability inventory, warnings, limitations, safety rules,
  recovery commands, roadmap, next work) in seven modes (full project /
  current document / bug-fix / next-phase / export / AI model / developer).
  Toolbar ▸ **Handoff** previews it, copies to clipboard, or writes it into
  the repository root. Dirty working trees are flagged inside the document
  so a handoff can never silently claim a clean state.

- **Phase 14 — UI quality engine (done):** new **`UIQualityEngine`** — answers
  *"is this a good interface?"*, not just *"does it build?"*. Heuristic checks:
  information **density** (controls per screen/area), **8-point-grid** and
  spacing consistency, **alignment near-misses** (1–3 px), **WCAG contrast**
  (text vs effective background, AA thresholds), **tap targets** (44 pt on
  touch devices only), **icon-only buttons** without labels, **text
  overflow/truncation** and unbreakable URL runs, **palette size**, effect
  **noise** (shadow/blur/gradient saturation), and missing hierarchy on busy
  screens. Produces 0–100 **scores with grades** (Design / Layout / Calm /
  Accessibility / Responsive + overall), top-five fixes, and per-finding
  recommendations with layer selection. Toolbar ▸ **Quality**.
- **Phase 15 — Component system (done):** new **`ComponentEngine`** — real
  reusable components, not presets. Create a master from the current selection,
  insert instances, **detach** instances, and **propagate** master edits to
  every instance with a single click. Detects **circular references** (direct
  and indirect, via a forward-reachability walk), diagnoses missing masters,
  duplicate names, and empty bodies. Cloning a layer preserves its
  `componentID` so paste keeps the link. Documents save/load components inside
  `.vuaproj`, with backwards-compatible decoding for older files (no
  `components` key → empty array). Generated SwiftUI emits one
  `<Name>ComponentView` struct per master and replaces instance bodies with a
  single constructor call; the export pipeline `swift build`s the result so
  components are proven portable. Sidebar tab **Components** lists masters
  with instance counts, diagnostics, and inline actions
  (insert / update-all / rename / delete).

- **Phase 16 — Advanced control presets (done):** **250 first-class control
  presets** — 50 each for knobs, faders, sliders, buttons, and switches —
  built combinatorially from 10 named **style families** (Classic, Minimal
  Flat, Modern Pro, Vintage, Neon, Glass, Pill, Mono, Danger, Success)
  × 5 size/parameter variants per kind. Every preset has unique id + unique
  name, real styling (background/accent/border/corner-radius/shadow/font
  weight), and sensible default **AU parameter metadata** (id, range, unit,
  default) for behaviour/binding work that follows. New sidebar tab
  **Controls** with a segmented kind picker, a horizontally-scrollable
  family filter, search across name/family/tags, and an adaptive grid of
  **live SwiftUI thumbnails** (no PNG generation — the renderer that draws
  the canvas draws the previews). Tap inserts at canvas centre.

- **Phase 17 — Functional asset metadata (done):** imported assets become
  functional controls, not just images. Each `Asset` carries optional
  **`AssetMetadata`** — role (backplate / knob cap / fader cap / track / meter /
  button / switch / decoration / icon / texture), function, interaction type,
  **rotation** and **drag** envelopes, and a production **control binding**
  (parameter id, range, default, unit, MIDI CC, AU parameter id, automation,
  stepped/continuous). Dropping an asset now resolves its **layer kind**
  (knobCap → `.knob`, faderCap → `.fader`, …) and attaches a `ControlMetadata`
  binding so generated SwiftUI emits a real `KnobView`/`FaderView`. The asset
  browser gains a per-asset **Functional Metadata** editor with role badges and
  live diagnostics (missing parameter id / range, invalid or inverted range,
  default out of range, MIDI CC out of 0–127, missing step count, role↔function
  mismatch). Backwards-compatible: legacy `Asset` JSON without `metadata`
  decodes unchanged.

- **Phase 18 — Existing UI import / screen loader (done):** a user-facing
  **Import Existing UI** workflow (File ▸ Import Existing UI… `⇧⌘I`, and an
  **Import UI** toolbar button) that turns a real app's SwiftUI into editable
  layers. Choose a `.swift` file **or** an app/repo folder; the engine scans
  with **SwiftSyntax** (no regex) for `struct … : View` / `var body`, ignoring
  preview-only helpers, and lists **import candidates** with a **confidence
  score** (supported ÷ total view calls), supported/unsupported counts, anchor
  presence, and warnings. Importing reconstructs the layer tree via the existing
  parser and records provenance — source path, **content hash** (FNV-1a), and
  view name. Unsupported constructs are counted and surfaced rather than
  silently dropped. Round-trip safety: **Apply to Source blocks when the source
  file changed on disk since import** (hash mismatch) and re-syncs the hash
  after a successful write. Repo scanning detects `Package.swift`/`.xcodeproj`/
  `.xcworkspace` and the conventional `Sources`/`Views`/`UI`/`Components` folders.

- **Phase 19 — Control asset library expansion (done):** new functional
  **Control Assets** sidebar with 120 reusable assets: 20 each for knobs,
  faders, sliders, buttons, switches, and meters. Each asset has a stable id,
  category, asset role/function, default size, visual style metadata,
  behaviour hint, range/default/unit where relevant, accessibility label
  template, tags, live thumbnail preview, and layer creation support. These
  complement the Phase 16 preset browser rather than replacing it; inserted
  assets create real non-zero layers with `ControlMetadata` so generated
  SwiftUI still emits buildable controls including `MeterView`.

- **Phase 20 — Control behaviour engine (done):** new
  **`ControlBehaviourEngine`** models how controls behave, not just how they
  look: rotary knobs, endless encoders, stepped and bipolar knobs, vertical
  faders, horizontal sliders, button presses, toggles, and read-only meters.
  Behaviour profiles include interaction mode, drag axis, rotation envelope,
  min/default/max, normalised value, unit, response curve, step/snap metadata,
  binding target, MIDI CC, AU parameter id, and automation flag. The inspector
  now exposes behaviour type, interaction, response curve, rotary angles,
  binding, AU id, MIDI CC, and automation. Generated SwiftUI remains buildable
  and emits behaviour/binding comments instead of fake app logic.

- **Phase 21 — Refined line tool (done):** line layers now support explicit
  start/end points, stroke width/colour/opacity through the existing style
  model, dashed and dotted strokes, caps, joins, arrowheads, divider mode,
  straight/curved/elbow connector modes, snap intent metadata (edge/centre),
  and Shift-style 0/45/90-degree constraint math in `LayerEngine`. The
  inspector exposes the line geometry and connector controls. Generated SwiftUI
  emits real `Path` output with line caps/joins/dashes/arrows/curves/elbows,
  and validation reports zero-length lines, invisible strokes, invalid arrows,
  unsupported/generated connector handles, and lines outside the canvas.

- **Phase 22 — Existing UI import polish (done):** the Import UI workflow now
  makes no-anchor imports explicit: the sheet warns that Apply to Source will
  be blocked and requires choosing **Import as editable temporary layers**.
  The toolbar reflects imported state, Repository shows the imported source
  with anchor status and timestamp, and the inspector shows source provenance.
  Apply-to-source now explains no-anchor blocking directly instead of silently
  producing no writes. Candidate previews show clearer source context while
  unsupported constructs remain surfaced as diagnostics.

- **Phase 23 — Asset transform system (done):** image/background asset layers
  now carry export-safe transform metadata for scale, horizontal/vertical flip,
  unit-space crop, blend mode, and a future texture-overlay hook. Existing
  style fields continue to drive rotation, opacity, shadow, blur, border,
  stroke, and corner radius. The inspector exposes the new transform controls,
  canvas rendering previews scale/flip/blend/crop, and generated SwiftUI emits
  supported transform modifiers plus crop/texture metadata comments. Validation
  reports crop outside image bounds, invisible transformed layers, very large
  transformed images, missing transformed assets, and rotated assets that move
  off-canvas.

- **Phase 24 — Raster drawing tool (done):** image/background layers now carry
  non-destructive raster paint metadata: paint mode, brush/pencil/eraser tool,
  brush size, opacity, hardness, colour, and grouped stroke arrays. New
  **`RasterDrawingEngine`** validates paint layers and flattens drawable
  strokes into a new PNG `Asset` without overwriting the original imported
  asset. The inspector exposes paint controls, generated SwiftUI records
  paint/export metadata comments, and validation reports no selected image
  layer, unsupported image formats, empty paint layers, PNG export failure
  states, and missing painted PNG assets.

All engines compile and pass the verification harness (`swift run VUACheck`, 381 checks).

## Requirements

- macOS 14+
- Swift 6 toolchain (Command Line Tools is enough — Xcode optional)

## Build & run

```bash
# Build a double-clickable .app (no Xcode needed)
./Scripts/make_app.sh
open "dist/Visual UI Architect.app"

# Or run directly during development
swift run VisualUIArchitect
```

## Verify

```bash
# Toolchain-independent engine checks (works without Xcode)
swift run VUACheck

# Full XCTest suite (requires Xcode or a CI toolchain with XCTest)
swift test
```

## Architecture

Modular Swift Package — no monolith. Each engine is a single-responsibility
target depending only on the shared domain layer (`VUACore`).

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `VUACore` | Platform-independent domain models (`Layer`, `Document`, geometry, color, constraints, assets, devices). `Codable`/`Sendable`. |
| `LayerEngine` | Tree mutation, hit-testing, align/distribute, snapping. |
| `CanvasEngine` | Drag/resize/marquee interaction geometry. |
| `AssetEngine` | Asset library: import PNG/JPEG/SVG/PDF (retina-aware), replace, tag, filter. |
| `LayoutEngine` | Responsive adaptation, size classes, breakpoints. |
| `ConstraintEngine` | Pin/center/proportional constraint solving. |
| `ValidationEngine` | WCAG contrast, touch targets, overlap/clipping, accessibility. |
| `GitEngine` | Local-first git: status/diff/commit/branch/history/rollback. |
| `CodeGenEngine` | Production-quality **SwiftUI** generation (UIKit/AppKit/React/Flutter/Compose scaffolded). |
| `AIEngine` | Provider-abstracted `AgentAdapter` — suggestions only, never edits files. |
| `PreviewEngine` | Flattened, absolutely-positioned render model for any front-end. |
| `RepositoryEngine` | **SwiftSyntax** parse (source → layers), source-fidelity write-back, repo scanner, file watcher, safe-apply pipeline. |
| `VUAControls` | Shipping reusable SwiftUI controls (`KnobView`/`FaderView`/`MeterView`/`ControlView`) that generated code imports. |
| `ExportIntegrityEngine` | Portable SwiftPM export: image-reference scanner (SwiftSyntax), asset copy + manifest, VUAControls source export, AU parameter manifest, diagnostics, report. |
| `PersistenceEngine` | `.vuaproj` bundle I/O, recent documents, **version snapshots**, **autosave/crash recovery** (with newer/older conflict classification), open-document registry, corrupted-doc diagnostics. |
| `WorkspaceEngine` | Repo/workspace safety: `WorkspaceResolver` → `WorkspaceContext` (repo root, branch, commit, dirty state, package inventory, confidence score) + wrong-repo/nested-repo/stale-scan/export-folder diagnostics, refreshed before every apply. |
| `BuildIntelligenceEngine` | Build lifecycle model, toolchain/package/lockfile diagnostics, repeatable command formatting, generated-import scanning, plain-English build-failure explanations. |
| `HandoffGeneratorEngine` | Deterministic HANDOFF.md generation (7 modes) with verified-state table, safety rules, and recovery commands. |
| `UIQualityEngine` | Heuristic interface-quality assessment: density, grid/spacing, alignment, WCAG contrast, tap targets, overflow, palette/effect noise → scored report with fixes. |
| `PresetEngine` | Reusable, insertable layout presets (app screens, panels, cards, dashboards, forms, plugin blocks). |
| `VisualUIArchitect` | SwiftUI app (MVVM): canvas, layer panel, repository browser, inspector, validation, toolbar. |

### Design principles

- **Bidirectional sync** — every layer carries a `CodeBinding` anchor so generated
  code round-trips to source.
- **Local-first & private** — no cloud upload, no telemetry, no remote code execution.
- **AI is optional and non-destructive** — it proposes `ProposedChange` values the
  user must approve; the app applies them, never the adapter.
- **Validate before commit** — the code preview surfaces blocking validation errors.

## Repository round-trip (Phase 2)

In the app, switch the sidebar to **Repository**:

1. **Open Repo** (a folder) or **Open File** (a `.swift` view).
2. Pick a SwiftUI view — it's parsed into editable layers on the canvas.
3. Edit visually (move/resize/restyle).
4. **Apply to Source** → *Apply* (validate + write + diff) or *Safe Apply* (also runs `swift build`).
5. Review the result sheet (stages, git diff, build output), then commit when ready.

Editing the file externally (e.g. in Xcode) refreshes the canvas automatically.

Parser scope: `View` structs whose `body` uses stacks (`VStack`/`HStack`/`ZStack`/`Group`)
and common leaves (`Text`, `Button`, `Image`, `Slider`, `Toggle`, `Label`). Write-back
currently round-trips `.position`/`.frame` by `accessibilityIdentifier` anchor; all other
source is preserved byte-for-byte.

## Assets & plugin controls (Phase 3)

- **Assets** sidebar tab: **Import** PNG/JPEG/SVG/PDF, search by name/tag,
  right-click to assign/replace/tag/lock/delete, and **drag a thumbnail onto the
  canvas** to create an image (or a locked background for `bg`-tagged assets).
- **Add Layer ▸ Plugin Controls**: knob, fader, slider, meter, switch. Each gets
  default **AU parameter metadata** editable in the inspector's *AU Parameter*
  section (param id, display, min/max/default, unit, continuous/steps).
- Generated SwiftUI emits a `// AU param:` comment and a conventional control
  view (`KnobView`/`FaderView`/`MeterView`) you supply, keeping the anchor stable.
- **Apply to Source** also round-trips assigned image asset names back into
  `Image(...)` calls.

## Export Integrity Pipeline (Phase 5)

Toolbar ▸ **Export** opens the export panel.

1. Pick a destination folder, set the module name, and choose whether to
   bundle `VUAControls` (recommended — the export is self-contained).
2. Click **Export**. The pipeline:
   - generates SwiftUI (no `#Preview` macro, for CLT-portable builds);
   - scans the generated source with **SwiftSyntax** for every `Image("…")`
     reference and matches each to an imported asset (no regex);
   - copies asset files into `Sources/<Module>/Resources/`, sanitising
     unsafe filenames and rejecting duplicates;
   - copies `VUAControls` sources into `Sources/VUAControls/` as a local module;
   - writes `Package.swift`, an asset manifest, a parameter manifest, and a
     Markdown export report;
   - surfaces diagnostics for missing assets, unsupported formats,
     placeholder parameters, unbound controls, and unsatisfiable imports.

The verification harness exercises this end-to-end: it exports a
Trinity8-style UI to a temp directory and **runs `swift build` on it** so the
test fails if generated code ever stops compiling outside Visual UI Architect.

## Roadmap

Next: richer write-back (style/text/structural inserts), navigation parsing,
relative (layer-to-layer) constraints in the editor, device chrome frames,
**MIDI CC / automation binding** for AU parameters, an Xcode `.xcassets`
export route, additional code-gen targets, and a plugin API.
